Installation
------------

Required
- Disapora
- maven

common-friends-dsn/
 -- Pod2/
 -- RecommendationSystem/

Run the following commands for compiling and starting the recommendation system

1) run the following build command at top level directory Pod2 and RecommendationSystem, to compile and package the project into a jar
   
   mvn clean package

2) start two terminals and run the following command to start the system [This will start the server and listeners simulating the diaspora pod]

 First start Pod2/   java -cp target/Pod2.jar com.recommendation.Executive
 
 Next Start RecommendationSystem/  java -cp target/Pod1.jar com.recommendation.Executive 



Recommendation system has two modes
- Production Mode
- Simulation Mode

Note: To run production mode, diaspora development environment has to be installed on the system.

Simulation Environment
---------------------

Pod1 has 4 local users with guid - usr1, usr2, usr3, usr4, 
Remote User: Usr5

FriendGraph G(V,E)
usr1 ->  usr3, usr4, usr5
usr2 -> usr3
usr3 -> usr1, usr2
usr4 -> usr1

Pod2 has 3 local users with guid - usr5, usr6, usr7
Remote User: Usr1

FriendGraph G(V,E)
usr5 -> usr6, usr1
usr6 -> usr5, usr7
usr7 -> usr6


- Recommendation Algorithm is starting at Pod1, usr3
- In order to change node where recommendation algorithm starts, login() method of com.recommendation.Client has to updated.


Running the Algorithm
---------------------

Once the step 1,2 are completed, you have two processes running simulating the diaspora pods. 

In this scenario pod1.jar is starting the 

In terminal where Pod1.jar is started,

Please enter the running mode
Enter 0 for Production Mode
Enter 1 for Simulation Mode

enter "1"

Enter 'start' to begin algo
Enter 'stop' to terminate
Enter 'restart' to run again

enter "start"

output: Recommendation Results will be displayed.
